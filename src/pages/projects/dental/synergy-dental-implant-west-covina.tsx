  and appealing focal point, the reception area. The interlocking geometric shapes that create a beautifully \
  crafted curved reception (with inside lighting) reflect the significance and quality of the center. From rich \
  wood finishes to the natural stones, all exude these natural elements in their highest quality, including the wood \
  backdrop that frames the Synergy logo. The flow of the colorful art throughout and the twigs and \
  other organic dÃ©cor shapes, create a colorful and inviting Center."
